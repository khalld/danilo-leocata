            I was born in Catania on March 27, 1996. Since i was a child I was passionate about pc and videogames. After completing the Liceo Scientifico I therefore decided to enroll in Computer Science. I am a fan of TV series, football and travelling. I define myself as a neat and precise person (not too much!). I like to work in a team, as I believe it is the best way to grow, plan and manage projects and activities and find the best solution for my task.
